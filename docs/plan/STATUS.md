# Status

The honest answer to "does it do X yet". Every component carries one of three
states and nothing else:

| State | Means |
| --- | --- |
| **proven** | The code exists, its tests pass, and the behavior has been exercised end to end against the real thing. |
| **written** | The code exists and passes its tests against a fake that enforces the real service's validation rules. It has never talked to the real service. |
| **planned** | Specified, not built. |

The distinction between proven and written is load bearing. A provider that has
only ever spoken to a fake is written, no matter how good the fake is.

This file is updated in the same pull request as the code it describes.

## What works today

```
af doctor      ten checks, each with a remediation
af init        reads a repository, writes a manifest, explains what it assumed
af explain     shows the effective configuration with every default resolved
af version     version, commit, edition, platform
```

Everything else in the command tree exists and returns AF-RUN-001.

## Phase 1. Foundation

| Sub-phase | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 Repository and governance | proven | Governance files, templates, CODEOWNERS, ADRs 0001 and 0002. |
| 1.2 Toolchain pinning and task runner | planned | |
| 1.3 Schemas and code generation | proven | `schemas/manifest.v1.json` is the source of truth; Go types mirror it. TypeScript generation lands with the runner. |
| 1.4 Continuous integration and gates | planned | |
| 1.5 Release pipeline | planned | |
| 1.6 Security baseline | planned | |
| 1.7 Documentation site skeleton | planned | |
| 1.8 Azure foundation (Terraform) | planned | Isolation boundary documented in `infra/ISOLATION.md`. Blocked on Q4. |
| 1.9 Test infrastructure and fakes | planned | |
| 1.10 Events, logging, and redaction | proven | 100 percent coverage on redaction, 454 ns/op with no allocations. |
| 1.11 Local state store and journal | proven | Crash injection at every step, plus a property test over random interleavings. |

## Phase 2. Engine core and CLI

| Sub-phase | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1 CLI framework | proven | Whole tree present; unimplemented commands return AF-RUN-001 and exit 2. |
| 2.2 Manifest loader and validator | proven | Fuzzed. Unknown keys are errors with a line and a suggestion. |
| 2.3 Detection engine | proven | Twelve analyzers. Deterministic, bounded, fuzzed, never executes repository code. |
| 2.4 `af init` | proven | Validates its own output before writing. |
| 2.5 Secrets subsystem | planned | `secrets.Value` exists and is proven. Sources and adapters are next. |
| 2.6 `af doctor` | proven | |
| 2.7 HUD | planned | |
| 2.8 Event sinks | proven | NDJSON with rotation, JSON, memory, and a replay reader. |

## Supporting packages

| Package | State | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internal/clock` | proven | 88 percent |
| `internal/secrets` | proven | 100 percent |
| `internal/redact` | proven | 100 percent |
| `internal/errors` | proven | 100 percent |
| `internal/events` | proven | 94 percent |
| `internal/journal` | proven | 95 percent |
| `internal/state` | proven | 83 percent |
| `internal/lock` | proven | 78 percent |
| `internal/manifest` | proven | 87 percent |
| `internal/detect` | proven | 81 percent |
| `internal/cli` | proven | 73 percent |

## Phases 3 to 14

Not started. Phase 3, the Postgres data layer, is next: the provider interface
and its conformance suite, the Docker provider, the masking engine, and the
verification scanner that makes an unverified golden unbranchable.
